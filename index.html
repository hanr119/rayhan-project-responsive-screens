          THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO RATING BOBA: RAY'S GUIDE
      </div>

          <div class="description">
            Boba, bubble tea, tapioca balls, milk tea, pearl tea, whatever you may call it. It is a popular drink that has taken the world by storm in the last couple of years. According to
            <a class="wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea">this</a> Wikipedia article, "is a tea-based drink. Originating in Taichung, Taiwan in the early 1980s, it includes chewy tapioca balls ("boba" or "pearls") or a wide range of other toppings."
            I grew up with this drink and was ecstatic when local shops began popping up, making the drink more accessible. With the rise of these places, people began to come up with lists of the top chains within an area, which became controversial amongst internet groups
            such as the Facebook group, "Subtle Asian Traits." As a person who enjoys boba myself, I've decided to create this personal guide to determine which boba places satisfy my preferences the most, however, it won't be easy to access. You must view this guide on both mobile and computer/large browsers to 
            access all the information. Otherwise, feel free to use this rating system to rate boba shops around you. Enjoy!
            <p>
              First things first, you must critique the tea, the juice, or the beverage itself. After all, toppings add mostly texture and sweetness to a drink, but will not be able to fix the drink if it tastes bad... So what determines if the drink is good? For teas, the syrup, the milk, and the tea quality are KEY.</p>

            <p>
              In milk teas, we always want to taste the underlying flavor of the tea leaves. We are not looking for a drink that simply tastes like milk. If a tea is bitter, it will be masked by the amount of milk. If a tea is steeped correctly, the milk will only have to be used to enhance the flavors of the tea. A good way to tell if a tea has a good milk-to-tea ratio is to look at the color. Certain teas have color tints to them that should show through the milk, not just a simple beige. For example, black tea has a warmer reddish undertone that should be visible even with milk. Now, the color isn't always determined by the ratio, but also by how the tea is steeped and the quality, which we will review soon.

            <p>
              This section is partially based on personal preference. Some of us like our drinks sweet, others like to taste the tea. For me, personally, I like the flavors of the tea and the syrup to blend well to create a harmonious taste. I personally want to taste something other than the syrup, which can override the soft tones of the tea if overused. Otherwise, it would make more sense to get a smoothie or juice drink instead of tea.

            <p>
              What is a tea without quality? My favorite boba shops always use high quality loose leaf teas steeped at the correct temperature. I mean, what is the point of going out of your way to go to a boba shop if they just serve bagged teas? 
              Steeping tea is an art and a skill which is well appreciated amongst most Asian cultures. Gentle nuances and characters of tea provide the drinker with a whole experience that is quite magical. Tea leaves should not be crushed or pressed,
              since that brings out a bitter flavor. Cooking tea at too low of a temperature will not bring out the flavor notes, while overheating certain teas will also make it bitter. Some teas must be steeped a certain number of times, with some of the product being tossed. 
              A good boba place will care for the little things, and that's what makes them so special.

          <p>
            Ah, here's the fun part: boba. Shops can either choose to buy packs of premade boba pearls, or make their own, fresh. Boba does not keep well for long periods of time, and often the texture is difficult to get right. Boba should never be hard in the center, powdery, or melting into each other. They should also have a flavor, not just a texture. The most popular types of boba are Honey or Brown Sugar boba.
             When made correctly, pearls are the same color and size throughout, and should have a slightly sweet and sticky syrup coating the outside. This helps sweeten the drink as well as keep the boba soft and consistent. The boba has a similar texture to gummies, but are easier to chew. Boba that is made in the shop is generally softer. Either way, it should always have a uniform shape to make sure that each one is cooked similarly. 
            Tapioca pearls should also taste sweet on their own, so that even if the drink runs out, we are still inclined to finish the boba instead of tossing it because it is tasteless!

            Topping Ratio is more important than we realize. Too little, and the topping will be completely finished before the drink is. Too much, and the drink will no longer be considered a drink and your mouth may feel tired from chewing. The best topping amount is usually under 1/3 of the cup, but greater than 1/4 of the cup. This ensures that topping will accompany you through the whole beverage!

          <p>
            Lastly, we will talk about other toppings. Other toppings include agar boba, grass jelly, fruit flavored jellies, chia or basil seeds, popping boba, etc. Sometimes people like to add multiple toppings. I generally like to max it out at 2 toppings, because too many toppings will cause the flavor to drown out the drink. Remember, toppings are meant to enhance the drink flavor and give it texture. That is what makes bubble tea so unique.

This is purely based on taste, though aesthetics may also be a value depending on your preferences. Presentation is always a plus. Now that you're at the end: here is a list of my favorite shops!
